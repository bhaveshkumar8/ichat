iChat is a web-based chat application, utilizing HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for front-end interactivity. Implemented real-time messaging using Node.js and Socket.IO which also store current chats history.

## instruction to be followed to connect the index.js(server) to client
follow the steps below:
1. Create a folder such as NodeServer.
2. Then open the terminal for NodeServer folder.
3. Then write command "npm init". This command is used in Node.js projects to initialize a new package.json file.
4. Then write command "npm i socket.io" to install socket.io modules.
5. Write command "npm i nodemon". Nodemon is a utility for Node.js that helps developers in the development process by automatically restarting the Node.js application when changes are detected in the project files. This saves developers from manually stopping and restarting the server each time they make changes to the code.
6. Now, you should add the index.js (server) file to the NodeServer folder.
7. Then open the terminal (command Prompt) for NodeServer folder and then write command "nodemon index.js" to run the server(which is index.js file).
8. Now the server is live at port 5500 and you can chat.
